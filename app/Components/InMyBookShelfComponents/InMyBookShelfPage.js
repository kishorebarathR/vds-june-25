              Growing up, my love for reading was deeply ingrained in me by my
              mother, who used to tell me stories from the puranas. As I grew
              older, my passion for reading continued to grow, accompanying me
              through my college years and beyond. I developed an insatiable
              appetite for books of all genres, with a particular fondness for
              history.

              Books taught me that life’s challenges are transient and continues
              to instill in me the courage and confidence to keep moving
              forward, no matter what obstacles may arise. The impact that books
              have had on my life is immeasurable. My readings have added value
              in my political career, as I can discern patterns in the events
              unfolding around me and confidently call them out.
